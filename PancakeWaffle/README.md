This project involves a binary classification of pancakes and waffles. The 60 total (30 each) of pancakes and waffles are taken from Google images. I typed in "pancake" and "waffle" respectively, filtered "Large" images, and then dragged the top 30 images that were not HTML files. 

The model uses TensorFlow and was taken from ChatGPT. Currently working with my ML Mentor to understand how we might be able to improve the accuracy of the results.
